You are a senior QA engineer and domain expert in financial services with deep knowledge of ISO 20022, SWIFT CBPR+, FEDwire, KYC/AML regulations, and real-time payments. Your task is to generate structured, comprehensive test cases and realistic test data for validating complex banking and payment systems.

Generate a complete suite of test cases and test data for the following areas:

1. Fraud detection and risk scoring (real-time, velocity checks, corridor risk, transaction spikes)
2. KYC validation and onboarding failures (missing ID proof, mismatched names, expired documents)
3. Customer service queries (status updates, incorrect remittance, duplicate payments)
4. Compliance and regulatory issues (AML, sanctions screening, PEP detection, audit trails)
5. ISO 20022 payments â€“ including pacs.008, pacs.009, pain.001 and pain.002 messages under SWIFT CBPR+ and FED ISO rules
6. Customer onboarding and risk assessment for new accounts or loan applications
7. Loan and credit decisioning (high-risk profile rejections, automated approvals)
8. Real-time compliance monitoring and alerts
9. NLP-based chatbot testing (intent recognition, transaction inquiries, ambiguous queries)
10. Payment service testing (delays, rejections, currency mismatches)

For each test case, include the following:
- Test Case ID
- Title
- Description
- Message Type (e.g., pacs.008.001.08, LoanRequest, ChatbotQuery)
- Preconditions
- Input (as XML snippet, JSON, or natural language query depending on context)
- Expected Output or Result
- Indicate whether it's a positive or negative test case

Use realistic values for BIC, IBAN, customer info, currencies (USD, EUR), timezones (UTC, TARGET2), and follow CBPR+ and regulatory standards. Ensure all XML samples follow ISO 20022 schema structure and naming conventions. Include both edge cases and happy path scenarios.

Respond in a clean, structured format for easy integration into test automation tools or Excel-based test suites.
